# Dirty data projetcs - Data cleaning
 
Worked on a real-life data analysis project by cleaning and analysing data in some messy data sets. 

Data cleaning is one of the most common tasks of a data analyst, taking around 80% of his time. It will never happen in isolation and will be the first step in the process of answering questions with data, whether that be exploratory analysis or building a predictive model.

Data cleaning tasks include load data into a single tool for analysis, as well as skills to deal with:    
- [x] missing values
- [x] duplicates and outliers
- [x] cleaning strings
- [x] reshaping and joining.
